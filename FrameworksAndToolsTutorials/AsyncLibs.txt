Default Mongo, Flask etc libraries dont have support for Asynchronous programming - SOME OF THEM HAVE BUT SELDOM



Asynchronous capable libraries list : 

1) aiofiles - for File input output operations

2) umongo - for MongoDb (contains both sync and async calls)

3) asyncpg - for PostgreSQL Database 

4) asyncio-redis - for Redis client
